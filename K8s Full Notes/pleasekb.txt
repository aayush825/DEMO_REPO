🧠 What is Kubernetes Monitoring?

Kubernetes monitoring is the process of collecting, analyzing, and visualizing metrics and logs from your Kubernetes cluster to:
Understand system health and performance
Detect and troubleshoot issues (like memory leaks, crashes)
Observe resource usage (CPU, memory, storage)
Ensure application reliability and uptime


🎯 Why is Monitoring Important in Kubernetes?

Because Kubernetes is dynamic and automated. Pods restart, scale up/down, get rescheduled — it’s not like managing a few static VMs.
So you need visibility to answer questions like:
Are all my nodes healthy?
Are any pods crashing or restarting often?
Is any container using too much CPU?
Are we nearing memory or disk limits?
Are my services available to users?


🧱 Levels of Monitoring in Kubernetes

| Level                   | What You Monitor                 | Examples                              |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Cluster Level**       | Nodes, CPU/memory, network, disk | Node health, resource usage           |
| **Pod/Container Level** | Pod status, container metrics    | CrashLoopBackOff, resource throttling |
| **Application Level**   | App-specific metrics             | HTTP errors, custom business metrics  |

🔄 How Monitoring Works in Kubernetes
Here’s a simplified flow using the Prometheus stack:

Prometheus scrapes metrics from:
kubelet
kube-state-metrics
cAdvisor
application /metrics endpoints
Prometheus stores the data in a time-series DB.
Grafana queries Prometheus and displays charts and graphs.
Alertmanager triggers alerts based on Prometheus rules.
Logs are collected by Fluent Bit and sent to Elasticsearch or Loki.

🧾 What is Logging?
Logging is the process of collecting, storing, and analyzing log data generated by applications, infrastructure (like Kubernetes), and the operating system. Logs help you:

Troubleshoot issues (e.g., failed pods)
Monitor performance
Audit system usage
Detect anomalies or security threats


📦 What is a Logging Pipeline?
A Logging Pipeline automates the flow of logs from their source to a storage backend and finally to a visualization/analysis tool. It typically follows this structure:

[Data Source] → [Aggregator] → [Log Storage] → [Visualization]

This ensures you can collect, filter, store, and view logs efficiently.


📊 Explanation of the Diagram You Shared  ||  lec87 udemy

🟥 1. Data Source
This is where logs are generated.

Examples:

Application logs (stdout, stderr, log files)
Kubernetes logs (from pods, kubelet, kube-proxy)
System logs (from the OS like /var/log/messages)
⏩ These logs need to be collected and forwarded.


🟦 2. Aggregator
This stage collects and processes logs from all sources and forwards them to a storage backend.

Tool: Fluentd

An open-source data collector.
Reads logs from multiple sources, transforms them, and forwards them.
It can filter, buffer, and route logs based on rules.
⏩ It standardizes the data format and sends it to the storage engine.


🟪 3. Log Storage
This is where logs are indexed and stored for querying.

Tool: Elasticsearch

A powerful search engine.
Stores logs as JSON documents.
Allows fast and complex queries.
⏩ It enables searching and analyzing logs with high performance.


🟩 4. Visualization
This is the frontend to explore, visualize, and analyze logs.

Tools:
Kibana: Designed for Elasticsearch. Log dashboards, alerts, timelines.
Grafana: Can visualize metrics and logs (integrates with Loki, Elasticsearch, etc.)

⏩ Gives insights into system/application behavior, errors, performance, etc.


🔄 Summary of the Logging Flow

     ↓
    Fluentd (Aggregator)
     ↓
Elasticsearch (Log Storage & Indexing)

Kibana / Grafana (Visualization & Analysis)



🧠 Why Use a Logging Pipeline?

Centralized Logging: All logs in one place
Scalability: Handles large volumes from containers
Structured Analysis: Search and filter logs quickly
Security: Audit trail and traceability
Automation: Alerts on failure, anomalies, etc.



🧠Troubleshooting Kubernetes application

✅ 1. Check Pod Status  -- kubectl get pods

🛠️ 2. Describe the Pod  -- kubectl describe pod webapp-1

Events at the bottom — useful for ImagePullBackOff, OOMKilled, FailedScheduling, etc.
Conditions — readiness/liveness probe failures


🐞 3. View Pod Logs -- kubectl logs webapp-1

🧪 4. Exec Into Pod (If Running) -- If your pod is running but the app isn’t behaving correctly: --> kubectl exec -it webapp-1 -- /bin/sh

📦 5. Check Deployment or ReplicaSet -- Sometimes the deployment config causes issues (wrong image, resource limits, etc.) -->  kubectl describe deployment webapp

🚥 6. Check Readiness/Liveness Probes -- 
❌ If /health endpoint is broken → Liveness probe fails → Pod restarts
❌ If readinessProbe fails → Pod not added to service → No traffic

⚙️ 7. Check Services -- If the app is up but not reachable:
kubectl get svc
kubectl describe svc webapp-service

🌐 8. Check Ingress or Load Balancer
If the app is externally exposed but not loading:

Check kubectl describe ingress
Ensure DNS resolves
Check firewall rules / NGINX logs

📊 9. Check Resource Limits

If pods are getting killed due to OOM or throttling:
kubectl describe pod webapp-1

Look for:
Reason: OOMKilled

Review the YAML:

resources:
  limits:
    memory: "256Mi"
    cpu: "500m"

🔐 10. Check ConfigMaps / Secrets
Sometimes apps crash due to missing or malformed config:

kubectl get configmap
kubectl describe configmap webapp-config

🧼 11. Check PVCs and Volume Mounts
Issues with persistent volumes can crash apps.

kubectl describe pod webapp-1

Watch for:

MountVolume.SetUp failed...

🔸CRD: CUSTOM RESOURCE DEFINITION


Helps to create our own custom resource. If you have some specific need and existing Kubernetes objects are not able to fulfill your requests then you can  create CRD. Further you can use that resource like other native communities object in your deployment or in your Kubernetes task.

In Kubernetes if you are going to create your own custom resource then user wise there is no difference b/w the custom resource and native resource.

First of all user need to register the custom resource with Kubernetes, whenever you are going to create the object of that custom resource, the prerequisite is before creation of the object, the resource must be registered with the Kubernetes, so that whenever you are trying to access that particular custom resource or whenever you are going to create the object of that particular custom resource your resource would be able to request the Cube API server and Cube API server will be able to process your request.


In Kubernetes, CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions) let you extend Kubernetes by defining your own resources, just like built-in ones (Pod, Service, Deployment, etc.).
Think of CRDs as a way to teach Kubernetes about new types of objects.
For example, if Kubernetes doesn’t know what a “BackupJob” is, you can define a CRD called BackupJob, and then you can start creating resources of type BackupJob.


🔸 Why Use CRDs?
🔧 Add custom behavior to Kubernetes
📦 Package your logic into custom controllers/operators
🧩 Helps build Kubernetes-native applications and tooling
🔍 Makes it easier to monitor and manage custom processes


🔸 Real-World Analogy
Let’s say Kubernetes is like a school. The school (Kubernetes) knows about students (Pods), teachers (Services), and classes (Deployments).

But now you want to introduce a new concept like “ClubMembership” — it doesn’t exist in the school’s handbook. So you write a new rule in the school handbook (CRD), and now you can register ClubMemberships for students.



🔸 Let’s Break the CRD YAML Down
Here’s a simplified view of what you saw:


apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: myapps.example.com
spec:
  group: example.com
  versions:
    - name: v1
      served: true
      storage: true
      schema:
        openAPIV3Schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            spec:
              type: object
              properties:
                name:
                  type: string
                replicas:
                  type: integer
  scope: Namespaced
  names:
    plural: myapps
    singular: myapp
    kind: MyApp
    shortNames:
      - ma


🔶 Part 1: What resource are we creating?
We are creating a new resource type called:
🔹 MyApp (kind)
🔹 It will live in the API group: example.com
🔹 When created, it will look like this:

apiVersion: example.com/v1
kind: MyApp
metadata:
  name: my-first-app
spec:
  name: "HelloApp"
  replicas: 3

Above is the custom resource this CRD is defining

🔶 Part 2: What will the resource do?

Nothing by itself — it’s just data, like a new config file format.
If you want the MyApp resource to take action (like create Pods), you’ll need to write a controller/operator to watch it. But for now:

➡️ It just stores two pieces of information:
A name (string)
A number of replicas (integer)


🔶 Part 3: What is openAPIV3Schema?

This is the schema definition that:
✅ Validates the shape of your custom resource
✅ Ensures only correct data is submitted
📘 Think of it like a Form Validator

Imagine a form:
Name = must be string
Age = must be number
That’s exactly what this openAPIV3Schema is doing.

Here’s that part of the YAML:

schema:
  openAPIV3Schema:
    type: object
    properties:
      spec:
        type: object
        properties:
          name:
            type: string
          replicas:
            type: integer



This says:
spec is an object

It should have:
name → a string (e.g., "MyApp")
replicas → an integer (e.g., 3)
So, if someone writes this (✅):

spec:
  name: MyApp
  replicas: 2

it is valid.

          properties:
            spec:
              type: object
              properties:
                name:
                  type: string
                replicas:
                  type: integer
  scope: Namespaced
  names:
    plural: myapps
    singular: myapp
    kind: MyApp
    shortNames:
      - ma

📝 Explanation:

group: Your custom API group (like a namespace for your CRD)
kind: This is the name you’ll use to refer to the object (MyApp)
scope: Namespaced means it lives within a namespace (like Pods); Cluster means it’s global
schema: Validates the object
versions: You can have different versions like v1, v2beta1, etc.


📄 Step 2: Apply the CRD
kubectl apply -f myapp-crd.yaml


📄 Step 3: Create an Object of Your New Type

apiVersion: example.com/v1
kind: MyApp
metadata:
  name: test-app
spec:
  name: HelloApp
  replicas: 3


Apply it:
kubectl apply -f myapp-object.yaml

Check it:
kubectl get myapps
kubectl describe myapp test-app


✅ What You Need to Remember While Writing CRDs

| Aspect             | Rule/Best Practice                                                      |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `apiVersion`       | Always use `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1`                                    |
| `metadata.name`    | Must be in format `<plural>.<group>` like `myapps.example.com`          |
| `names.kind`       | Capitalized singular (CamelCase) — like `MyApp`                         |
| `names.plural`     | Must be lowercase, plural of your kind                                  |
| `schema`           | Highly recommended to add OpenAPI v3 schema for validation              |
| `scope`            | Choose `Namespaced` if it should live inside namespaces                 |
| `shortNames`       | Optional but useful for typing quickly (`kubectl get ma`)               |
| `versions.storage` | Only one version can have `storage: true` (used as the default version) |



🔹 Real-Life Use Case Example

🧱 1. Goal: What Are We Trying to Do?
Let’s say your team runs databases and needs to automate backups.

Instead of:

Writing ad-hoc cron jobs outside Kubernetes 
Or managing backup configs in random YAML files
You want to declare backups as native Kubernetes resources like this:

apiVersion: storage.example.com/v1
kind: BackupJob
metadata:
  name: daily-db-backup
spec:
  database: mysql-db
  schedule: "0 2 * * *"
  retentionDays: 7


This is NOT something Kubernetes understands natively.
So, you will create a CRD to define this new kind of object — a BackupJob.


🧩 2. Step-by-Step Flow of What Happens

✅ Step 1: Define the CRD (Custom Resource Definition)
This is a "blueprint" — like adding a new form field in a system.


apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: backupjobs.storage.example.com
spec:
  group: storage.example.com
  versions:
    - name: v1
      served: true
      storage: true
      schema:
        openAPIV3Schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            spec:
              type: object
              properties:
                database:
                  type: string
                schedule:
                  type: string
                retentionDays:
                  type: integer
  scope: Namespaced
  names:
    plural: backupjobs
    singular: backupjob
    kind: BackupJob


This CRD:

Registers a new type: BackupJob
Allows you to use YAMLs that include:
database, schedule, and retentionDays

Now, Kubernetes knows how to store and validate BackupJob objects



✅ Step 2: Use That CRD to Create Backup Objects

Now that the CRD is registered, you can create actual objects like this:

apiVersion: storage.example.com/v1
kind: BackupJob
metadata:
  name: daily-db-backup
spec:
  database: mysql-db
  schedule: "0 2 * * *"
  retentionDays: 7


When you run:

kubectl apply -f backup-daily.yaml

Kubernetes stores it like it would store a Pod or Deployment — but it won’t do anything by itself.
It’s just data stored in etcd, like a config file.


✅ Step 3 (Optional but Powerful): Build a Controller (Operator)
Now you write a controller (also called an Operator) that watches for new BackupJob resources and acts on them.

For example:

"Whenever I see a new BackupJob:

Create a Pod that runs a mysqldump
Store it in AWS S3
Retry if failed
Keep backups for X days"

This controller is like a smart background worker.
It watches and reacts to your custom objects.



📌 Summary
| Concept             | Meaning                                                         |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CRD**             | Defines a new object schema in Kubernetes (`BackupJob`)         |
| **Custom Resource** | Each `BackupJob` object you create from that schema             |
| **Controller**      | Watches those objects and takes action (e.g., run backups)      |
| **Schema**          | Validates that input values are correct (`string`, `int`, etc.) |


💡 Example Use Cases of CRDs (Real World)
BackupJob — to define database backup policies
KafkaTopic — to define new Kafka topics declaratively
TLSCertificate — to auto-manage HTTPS certs (e.g., cert-manager uses this)
DatabaseCluster — to define high-availability DBs (used by Operators like CrunchyDB or MongoDB Atlas Operator)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🛡️ Kubernetes Access Control 

Access control in Kubernetes ensures that only authorized users or services can perform certain actions on resources (like creating Pods, reading Secrets, deleting Deployments, etc.).

There are three key layers:

🔐 1. Authentication – Who are you?  (common methods: Certificates. Bearer Tokens, OIDC, Service Accounts)  # 📌 Authentication only proves identity – it doesn’t grant permissions.
🧾 2. Authorization – What can you do? (Once authenticated, Kubernetes checks if the user is allowed to do the requested action) (✅ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC))

✅ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

RBAC lets you define:
Roles: A set of permissions (verbs like get, create, delete) over resources (pods, deployments, etc.)
RoleBindings: Attach roles to users, groups, or service accounts

📘 Example:
# Role: can read pods
kind: Role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  namespace: dev
  name: pod-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]




# Bind this role to user 'ayush'
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: read-pods-binding
  namespace: dev
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: ayush
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: pod-reader
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io


✅ You can also use ClusterRoles and ClusterRoleBindings for cluster-wide permissions.


🔎 3. Admission Control – Can we allow this request to proceed? (This comes after authentication and authorization. It intercepts every API request before it's persisted to etcd.)

Admission controllers are a powerful Kubernetes-native feature that helps to define and customize what is allowed to run on K8s cluster.
They can block pods from running if the cluster is out of resources or if the  images are not secure.

🎯 Roles & Powers of Admission Controllers:

Enforce security policies (e.g. block privileged pods)
Inject sidecars (e.g. Istio)
Default values (e.g. if labels or tolerations are missing)
Quotas (e.g. restrict number of pods or memory)
Prevent risky operations (e.g. deleting important namespaces)


🔧 Types of Admission Controllers

1️⃣ Validating Admission Controllers

Only validate the object/request.
Cannot modify the request.
Example: PodSecurity, ValidatingAdmissionWebhook

2️⃣ Mutating Admission Controllers

Can modify the request before it’s saved.
Example: Add labels, default values, inject sidecars.
Example: MutatingAdmissionWebhook



🧠 What Are Resource Requests and Limits?

Kubernetes allows you to define how much CPU and memory (RAM) a container:
Requests: Minimum amount of CPU/memory guaranteed for a container.
Limits: Maximum amount of CPU/memory the container can use.


🧭 Why Are Requests and Limits Important?

✅ Stable Scheduling

The Kubernetes scheduler uses requests to decide where to place the Pod.
A node must have enough free resources to satisfy all requests of a Pod.

🔐 Isolation & Fairness
Limits prevent one container from consuming all the resources and starving others.

🚨 Crash Prevention
If a container exceeds its memory limit, it is killed.
If it exceeds CPU, it's throttled (not killed).

📊 Effective Resource Utilization
Helps optimize cost and avoid overprovisioning or underutilization


⚙️ Key Term
| Term              | Meaning                                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `requests.cpu`    | Guaranteed CPU (millicores, e.g. `500m` = 0.5 vCPU)     |
| `requests.memory` | Guaranteed Memory (e.g. `256Mi`, `1Gi`)                 |
| `limits.cpu`      | Max CPU the container can use (if exceeded → throttled) |
| `limits.memory`   | Max memory container can use (if exceeded → **killed**) |


📦 Example YAML: Resource Requests and Limits
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: resource-demo
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app-container
    image: nginx
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "256Mi"
        cpu: "250m"
      limits:
        memory: "512Mi"
        cpu: "500m"


🧠 Interpretation:

Scheduler guarantees:
This pod gets at least 256Mi memory and 0.25 CPU when scheduled.

Container behavior:
Can use up to 512Mi memory and 0.5 CPU.

If it tries to use more:

Memory: Container killed.
CPU: Container throttled (slowed down), not killed.


🔧 How Are Requests and Limits Applied?

You can apply them at multiple levels:
Per-container (recommended)

Default per namespace using:

LimitRanges: Sets default requests/limits.
ResourceQuotas: Caps total resources per namespace.


📂 Example: Namespace LimitRange

apiVersion: v1
kind: LimitRange
metadata:
  name: limit-range-example
  namespace: dev
spec:
  limits:
  - default:
      cpu: "500m"
      memory: "512Mi"
    defaultRequest:
      cpu: "200m"
      memory: "256Mi"
    type: Container


🚫 What Happens When You Don't Set These?

Pods can consume as much as they want, which may:
Overload nodes.
Cause OOM kills to innocent pods.
Result in unpredictable performance.
Affect other workloads sharing the same node.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🧠 What Is a ResourceQuota in Kubernetes?
A ResourceQuota is a limit set at the namespace level that controls the total resource consumption for that namespace.
It acts like a budget for how many resources (CPU, memory, objects, etc.) can be used within a namespace.


🧱 Why Use ResourceQuotas?
✅ Prevent resource hogging in multi-tenant clusters.
✅ Ensure fair usage across teams/projects.
✅ Avoid scenarios where one team uses all CPU or memory and others starve.
✅ Enforce soft limits (requests) and hard limits (limits).


📂 What is a Namespace?
Namespaces in Kubernetes are like logical partitions or virtual clusters within a physical cluster.
Separate different teams/projects/environments.
Isolate: Resources, RBAC, and ResourceQuotas are namespace-scoped.


🏗️ How ResourceQuota and Namespace Work Together
You define a ResourceQuota inside a namespace.
All Pods, Deployments, PVCs, etc., in that namespace must stay within the quota.


✅ Example Use Case
Let’s say:

You have a cluster shared by two teams: dev and qa.
You want to restrict dev namespace to 2 CPUs, 4Gi Memory, and 5 Pods.

🔧 YAML Example: ResourceQuota

apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: dev-quota
  namespace: dev
spec:
  hard:
    pods: "5"
    requests.cpu: "2"
    requests.memory: "2Gi"
    limits.cpu: "4"
    limits.memory: "4Gi"


Explanation:
| Field                          | Meaning                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pods: 5`                      | Max 5 Pods can be created in the namespace.                 |
| `requests.cpu`                 | Total sum of requested CPU across all containers ≤ 2 cores. |
| `limits.cpu`                   | Total max CPU allowed across all containers ≤ 4 cores.      |
| Same logic applies for memory. |                                                             |


🛠️ How to Apply

Create the Namespace: ->> kubectl create namespace dev
Apply the Quota:  ->>  kubectl apply -f dev-quota.yaml
Verify:  ->>   kubectl describe quota dev-quota -n dev


🧪 What Happens If a Pod Exceeds the Quota?

If you try to create a Pod that violates the quota, you get an error:
Error from server (Forbidden): 
exceeded quota: dev-quota, 
requested: requests.cpu=2, used: 1.5, limited: 2


💡 Common ResourceQuota Fields
| Field                    | Description            |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| `pods`                   | Total number of Pods   |
| `requests.cpu`           | Total requested CPU    |
| `requests.memory`        | Total requested memory |
| `limits.cpu`             | Total maximum CPU      |
| `limits.memory`          | Total maximum memory   |
| `persistentvolumeclaims` | Number of PVCs         |
| `services`               | Number of services     |


⛓️ Optional: Combine with LimitRange

A LimitRange can enforce default values for requests/limits per Pod.
ResourceQuota works with those limits to enforce namespace-wide limits.


📊 View Resource Usage
kubectl describe quota <quota-name> -n <namespace>


It shows:

Hard limits
Current usage
Remaining capacity

🧠 What Is a ConfigMap?

A ConfigMap in Kubernetes is an object used to store non-sensitive configuration data in key-value pairs.
It lets you decouple environment-specific configuration from application code, making your app more portable and easier to manage.


🧾 Why Use a ConfigMap?
Store environment variables, command-line args, config files, etc.
Keep config separate from container images.
Easily update app behavior without rebuilding images.


🧱 Example Use Case
Imagine an app needs:

An environment variable: LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
A config file with database settings
You can store both in a ConfigMap and mount/use them in your Pod.



🛠️ Ways to Create a ConfigMap

✅ 1. Imperative (via CLI)
a. From literal values:
kubectl create configmap app-config --from-literal=LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG --from-literal=APP_MODE=production

b. From a file:
kubectl create configmap app-config --from-file=app.properties

c. From a directory:
kubectl create configmap app-config --from-file=config-dir/


✅ 2. Declarative (YAML)
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: app-config
data:
  LOG_LEVEL: "DEBUG"
  APP_MODE: "production"
  database.properties: |
    db.host=localhost
    db.port=5432

Apply it:
kubectl apply -f configmap.yaml


🧩 Ways to Use a ConfigMap in a Pod

🔹 1. As Environment Variables
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: app-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app-container
      image: myapp
      envFrom:
        - configMapRef:
            name: app-config


Each key becomes an environment variable.

🔹 2. As Individual Environment Variables

env:
  - name: LOG_LEVEL
    valueFrom:
      configMapKeyRef:
        name: app-config
        key: LOG_LEVEL

🔹 3. As Volume Mounts (Files)

volumes:
  - name: config-vol
    configMap:
      name: app-config

containers:
  - name: app-container
    image: myapp
    volumeMounts:
      - name: config-vol
        mountPath: /etc/config


Every key becomes a file under /etc/config/, and its value is the file content.


🔍 Viewing ConfigMap
kubectl get configmap app-config -o yaml

✏️ Updating a ConfigMap
kubectl edit configmap app-config

Or re-apply with kubectl apply.

⚠️ Note: Updating a ConfigMap does NOT automatically restart Pods using it.


✅ Best Practices
| Practice                              | Description                            |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Use ConfigMaps for non-sensitive data | Use **Secrets** for sensitive info     |
| Separate configs from app code        | Makes deployments more flexible        |
| Use versioned ConfigMaps for rollback | Prevent accidental changes             |
| Keep them small                       | Large binary/config files aren't ideal |


✅ Pros and ❌ Cons
| ✅ Pros                               | ❌ Cons                               
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Decouple config from code            | No auto-reload on update             |
| Easy to use with env vars or volumes | Must restart app to reflect changes  |
| Declarative or imperative support    | Not encrypted (use Secrets for that) |


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🔐 What is a Kubernetes Secret?
A Secret is a Kubernetes object that is used to store sensitive data such as:

Passwords
Tokens
SSH keys
TLS certificates
API keys
It keeps such data separate from your application code and base64-encoded, unlike ConfigMap which is for non-sensitive data.


🧠 Why Use Secrets?
To avoid hardcoding sensitive values in your Pod specs or images.
To limit visibility and access via Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
To enhance security by reducing accidental exposure.



📦 Types of Kubernetes Secrets
| Secret Type                      | Description                                             |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Opaque`                         | Default type, used for arbitrary key-value pairs.       |
| `kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson` | Used to store Docker credentials for pulling images.    |
| `kubernetes.io/tls`              | Used for storing TLS certificates (private key + cert). |
| `bootstrap.kubernetes.io/token`  | Used for bootstrap tokens (internal cluster use).       |



🛠️ How to Create a Secret
✅ 1. Imperative Method (CLI)

a. From Literal Values

kubectl create secret generic db-secret \
  --from-literal=username=admin \
  --from-literal=password='Pa$$w0rd!'

b. From a File

kubectl create secret generic certs-secret \
  --from-file=ssh-privatekey=~/.ssh/id_rsa \
  --from-file=ssh-publickey=~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub



✅ 2. Declarative (YAML)
You must base64 encode the values.

echo -n 'admin' | base64        # Output: YWRtaW4=
echo -n 'Pa$$w0rd!' | base64    # Output: UGEkJHcwcmQh

Then use:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: db-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  username: YWRtaW4=
  password: UGEkJHcwcmQh


Apply it:
kubectl apply -f secret.yaml


🧩 How to Use Secrets in Pods?
🔹 1. As Environment Variables

env:
  - name: DB_USERNAME
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: db-secret
        key: username

This sets the secret value as an env variable inside the container.


🔹 2. As Volume Mount (Files)
volumes:
  - name: secret-vol
    secret:
      secretName: db-secret

containers:
  - name: app-container
    volumeMounts:
      - name: secret-vol
        mountPath: /etc/secret
        readOnly: true

Each key becomes a file. Inside /etc/secret/username you'd find the value admin.


🔹 3. As ImagePullSecret
To pull a private Docker image:

kubectl create secret docker-registry my-reg-secret \
  --docker-username=<user> \
  --docker-password=<pass> \
  --docker-server=<registry> \
  --docker-email=<email>

Then reference it in your pod spec:
imagePullSecrets:
  - name: my-reg-secret

🔐 What is securityContext in Kubernetes?

The securityContext defines security-related configurations that apply to:
A Pod (pod.spec.securityContext)
A Container inside a pod (pod.spec.containers[].securityContext)
It tells the kubelet and container runtime how to run the container from a security perspective — like what user it runs as, what permissions it has, if it can use privilege escalation, etc.


🎯 Why is it important?

To enforce principle of least privilege
To prevent privilege escalation
To protect the host system
Mandatory topic in CKAD & CKA


🔍 Pod-Level vs Container-Level

| Level           | Applies To                              | Scope                                  |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Pod-level       | `pod.spec.securityContext`              | Applies to all containers in the pod   |
| Container-level | `pod.spec.containers[].securityContext` | Applies only to the specific container |


If both are set, container-level overrides pod-level.


🧩 Key Fields in securityContext

| Field                      | Description                                                |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `runAsUser`                | Run container processes as a specific UID                  |
| `runAsGroup`               | GID of the container process                               |
| `fsGroup`                  | Group ID for mounted volumes (shared)                      |
| `readOnlyRootFilesystem`   | Mount root FS as read-only                                 |
| `allowPrivilegeEscalation` | Prevents setuid/setgid binaries from escalating privileges |
| `privileged`               | Full root access to host (❗ risky!)                        |
| `capabilities`             | Add/remove Linux kernel capabilities                       |




✅ Minimal Pod SecurityContext Example

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: secure-pod
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsUser: 1000         # UID of the container process
    runAsGroup: 3000        # GID of the container process
    fsGroup: 2000           # GID for volumes (shared access)
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: busybox
      command: ["sleep", "3600"]


This pod will run with UID 1000 and GID 3000. Any mounted volume files will be accessible to group ID 2000.


🛠️ Container-Level Example with readOnlyRootFilesystem

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: readonly-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: nginx
      securityContext:
        readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
        runAsUser: 1001
        runAsGroup: 1001
        allowPrivilegeEscalation: false


🔐 Example with capabilities
Linux capabilities allow fine-grained control of root privileges

securityContext:
  capabilities:
    drop:
      - ALL
    add:
      - NET_BIND_SERVICE   # Only allow binding to ports <1024



📌 Common CKAD Scenarios You Might Get

| Scenario                           | SecurityContext Use               |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Run a container as a specific user | `runAsUser`, `runAsGroup`         |
| Make root filesystem read-only     | `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true`    |
| Add only needed capabilities       | `capabilities`                    |
| Ensure container can’t gain root   | `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false` |
| Share volume files with group      | `fsGroup`                         |



🔍 Inspect Security Context on Running Pod
kubectl get pod secure-pod -o yaml



💡 Bonus: Use Case Example
Imagine you run a Node.js app in a container. You want to:

Run it as a non-root user (UID 1001)
Prevent it from writing to the root filesystem
Deny any privilege escalation


apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: secure-node
spec:
  containers:
    - name: node
      image: node:18-alpine
      command: ["node"]
      args: ["app.js"]
      securityContext:
        runAsUser: 1001
        readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
        allowPrivilegeEscalation: false



🧩 What does allowPrivilegeEscalation: false actually do?
It prevents a process inside the container from gaining more privileges than its parent process — even if the binary tries to escalate (e.g., using setuid, sudo, or similar tricks).


🧪 So if someone tries to run the container as root?
That depends on whether you’ve explicitly told Kubernetes not to run as root

| Setting                           | What it does                                                     | Effect                           |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `runAsUser: 1000`                 | Run the container as non-root UID 1000                           | ✅ Non-root                       |
| `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false` | Block attempts to gain *extra* privileges inside container       | 🛑 No `sudo`, no `setuid` tricks |
| `runAsNonRoot: true`              | Enforce that container **must not run as root**, even by mistake | ✅ Strict enforcement             |


🔒 Best Practice: Use All 3 Together

securityContext:
  runAsUser: 1000
  runAsNonRoot: true
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false

🧾 What is a ServiceAccount in Kubernetes?

A ServiceAccount is an identity that pods use to interact with the Kubernetes API.
Every namespace contains Default service account

🔐 Think of it like:

User account → for humans (e.g., kubectl)
Service account → for pods/applications to access the API securely


✅ Why is a ServiceAccount important?

By default, each pod is automatically assigned a ServiceAccount (usually default), and that account can be used to:

Interact with the Kubernetes API (e.g., list pods, read secrets)
Be authenticated inside the cluster
Access other cluster resources, like Secrets, ConfigMaps, etc.

You create specific service accounts when you want to:

Restrict API access
Attach RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) permissions
Isolate privileges between apps
Improve security



📦 Example: Using a ServiceAccount in a Pod

1️⃣ Create a service account

apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: my-serviceaccount
  namespace: default

2️⃣ Assign it to a Pod

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  serviceAccountName: my-serviceaccount  # ← This line is key
  containers:
  - name: mycontainer
    image: busybox
    command: ["sleep", "3600"]


✅ This pod will now use my-serviceaccount to authenticate with the API server


📜 Default Behavior

When you create a pod without specifying serviceAccountName, it gets the default service account of the namespace:

kubectl get serviceaccount

This will show:

NAME      SECRETS   AGE
default   1         5d


🔐 ServiceAccount + RBAC (Role Binding)
ServiceAccounts don’t have permissions by default (only very limited API access). You usually assign roles to them using RBAC.

Example: Allow a pod to list pods

apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: pod-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "list"]


apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: pod-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "list"]



🧪 CKAD Tip
You’ll often be asked to:

Create a pod using a specific service account
Create a service account and bind roles
Troubleshoot permission errors (403 → missing RBAC permissions)

🧾 What is a Service in Kubernetes?

A Service in Kubernetes is a stable network abstraction that provides a single IP and DNS name to access a set of pods.
Pods themselves are ephemeral — they get new IPs when restarted or replaced — so you can’t reliably connect to them directly.
A Service solves this problem by acting as a permanent “front door” for a group of pods.
Service account provides an identity for processes that run in a Pod.


🎯 Why is a Service used?

Stable Access → Pods come and go, but the service IP stays the same.
Load Balancing → Routes traffic across multiple pod replicas.
Service Discovery → Gives a DNS name for the application (my-service.default.svc.cluster.local).
Decoupling → Clients don’t need to know pod IPs — they just talk to the Service.


⚙ How Services & Endpoints Work Together
Think of it like:

Service → The address you connect to (IP + DNS name)
Endpoint → The actual pod IPs behind the service


🔹 Flow:
You create a Service and give it a selector that matches pod labels.
Kubernetes finds all pods that match those labels.
It creates an Endpoint object containing the IP addresses + ports of those pods.
When you connect to the Service, it automatically routes traffic to one of those endpoint pods (round-robin by default)


📌 Example: Service + Endpoint
Let’s say you have an app with 2 replicas:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80


Now you create a Service:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myapp-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: myapp   # Matches the pod labels
  ports:
    - port: 80           # Port exposed by Service
      targetPort: 80     # Pod's containerPort


🔍 What happens behind the scenes?

1.Kubernetes sees the selector in the Service:
app: myapp

2.Finds all pods with that label → these are your endpoints.

3.Creates an Endpoints object:
kubectl get endpoints myapp-service -o yaml

eg:
subsets:
  - addresses:
      - ip: 10.244.1.5
      - ip: 10.244.2.8
    ports:
      - port: 80

4.When you connect to myapp-service:

Traffic goes to kube-proxy (service routing)
kube-proxy sends the request to one of the endpoint pods
Load balances between them

🧠 Key Points for CKAD
Service without selector → You can manually define endpoints (used for external services).
Service automatically updates when pods come/go — endpoints list is dynamic.
Endpoints object is created automatically only if the service has a selector.

💡 Debugging Tips
kubectl get svc myapp-service
kubectl get endpoints myapp-service
kubectl exec -it <pod> -- curl myapp-service

EXAMPLE:

DEPLOYMENT_ONE.YML

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment-1.0
  labels:
    app: nginx-1.0
    env: prod
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx-1.0
      env: prod
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx-1.0
        env: prod
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx:1.19
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80


DEPLOYMENT_TWO.YML

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment-1.1
  labels:
    app: nginx-1.1
    env: prod

spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx-1.1
      env: prod
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx-1.1
        env: prod
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: anshuldevops/magicalnginx:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80

Apply both DEPLOYMENT_ONE.YML and DEPLOYMENT_TWO.YML


SERVICE.YML

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: custom-service
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 8080   # the port which you are defining in front of the ports, on this particular port service will listen the traffic.
      targetPort: 80  # the port which we are defining in the targetport here the traffic will get forwarded


What is the port and what is the target port?
You may get the question on this that on which particular port service will listen, the traffic and
on which particular port service will forward the traffic.


 USER
  |  (so service is listening user on this port 8080)
  |
SERVICE
 /|\  (then service frwd this traffic on port 80) (basically here the pod runs)
80  \
    80


Once service created apply it,

then check at kubectl get services -o wide



how will the service get to know which pod traffic it need to listen:
To service let know, on which particular to forward the traffic we will define endpoints, it is a resource in Kubernetes just like service



example: endpoint

apiVersion: v1
kind: Endpoints
metadata:
	name: custom-service
subsets:
	-addresses:
		-ip: 10.1.0.60   #so over here in endpoints we are defining the ip address of our pods over which we want to frwd the traffic
	ports:
	    	-port:80


For example: above we created to yml files DEPLOYMENT_ONE.YML, DEPLOYMENT_TWO.YML ,so what you do , kubectl get pods
And once you do it , you will get the ip take that ip and put in the address section, so then the traffic will be shifted to that pods
once i create this endpoint, it will connect with the service.


---> How Will service know that to which endpoints it need to get connected?
for that we need to keep the name same of "services and the endpoints", if the name it will automatically detect.

Now whenever you run kubectl get service or kubectl describe service custom-service
you will get the ip
and when you curl that ip with port 8080 binding, yo will get your pod content

example: 47.3454.654:8080

------------> one more imp point, in endpoint , in the addresses section if you enter multiple ip(for example ip f second port) and when you run this 47.3454.654:8080
, sometimes you will get the content of first , sometime of second, due to the multiple pod connection from same service, so sometime we get traffic from pod, sometime from pod2


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As we have hardcoded the ip in endpoints? what will happen if pods are refreshed , the ip will change then how to deal with it? now we will discuss on it...

----> USING SELECTORS FOR DYNAMIC ENDPOINTS  <--------------
A selector is a label filter that tells a Service which pods it should send traffic to.

🔄 How Do Dynamic Endpoints Work?

When you create a Service with a selector:

Kubernetes watches for pods that match that selector.
It automatically creates an Endpoints object that contains those pods’ IP addresses + ports.
If:

A new pod matching the label appears → added to endpoints
A pod is deleted or crashes → removed from endpoints
Pod label changes → added/removed accordingly
📌 This is dynamic — you never manually edit the endpoints.


📦 Example: Service with Selector → Dynamic Endpoints
1️⃣ Create some pods with labels

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod1
  labels:
    app: myapp
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod2
  labels:
    app: myapp
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80

2️⃣ Create a Service with a selector

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: myapp  # This matches pod1 and pod2
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80


3️⃣ See what happens with endpoints
kubectl get endpoints my-service -o yaml

You’ll see something like:

subsets:
- addresses:
  - ip: 10.244.0.5
    targetRef:
      kind: Pod
      name: pod1
  - ip: 10.244.0.6
    targetRef:
      kind: Pod
      name: pod2
  ports:
  - port: 80


If you now:

kubectl delete pod pod2

… and check again:

subsets:
- addresses:
  - ip: 10.244.0.5
    targetRef:
      kind: Pod
      name: pod1


👉 Endpoints updated automatically.


📌 If You Use a Selector → No Manual Endpoint Creation
Correct ✅

If selector: is present → Kubernetes manages the Endpoints object for you.
You should not manually create endpoints in this case.


🛠 When Would You NOT Use a Selector?
Sometimes:

You want to connect to an external service (e.g., database outside Kubernetes)
Or connect to pods in another namespace without labels
Or connect to legacy workloads not controlled by Kubernetes

In those cases:

Create a Service without selector:
Manually create an Endpoints resource with IPs/hostnames.


🔹 Dynamic Endpoints with Selector (Auto-managed)

🧾 Recap: What’s a Service?

A Kubernetes Service provides a stable IP and DNS name to access one or more pods.

🔹 The Four Main Service Types
| Service Type          | Access Scope                     | Use Case                                      |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `ClusterIP` (default) | Internal only                    | Communication between pods inside the cluster |
| `NodePort`            | External (via node’s IP + port)  | Simple external access without cloud LB       |
| `LoadBalancer`        | External (via cloud provider LB) | Production-grade public access                |
| `ExternalName`        | Redirect to external hostname    | Connect Kubernetes to an external service     |



1️⃣ ClusterIP (Default)

📜 Description
Exposes the service inside the cluster only.
Gets a cluster-internal IP that is not routable from outside.

📦 Example YAML

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: backend-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: backend
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 8080


✅ Pros

Secure (not exposed outside)
Default and simplest type
Great for microservice-to-microservice communication

❌ Cons
No direct access from outside the cluster

🎯 When to Use
Internal services (e.g., backend DB, internal APIs)


🔹 What is a NodePort Service?

A NodePort service exposes your application outside the cluster by opening a port (from range 30000–32767) on every node in the cluster.
Any request coming to <NodeIP>:<NodePort> will be forwarded to the service → then to your pod(s).
Works without needing a cloud load balancer.
Useful for testing or small environments.
NodePort range: 30000–32767.
Available on every node’s IP.


🔄 How NodePort Works (Traffic Flow)

Let’s imagine:

You have a pod running an NGINX web server on port 8080.
You expose it with a NodePort service on 30080.

Flow:

Client Request → Hits <NodeIP>:30080 (Node’s IP address and NodePort)
Kube-proxy → Intercepts request on that node
Service ClusterIP → Forwards request to one of the pod endpoints
Pod → Handles the request and sends the response back


📦 Example
1️⃣ Pod + Deployment

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myweb
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myweb
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080


2️⃣ NodePort Service

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-nodeport
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: myweb
  ports:
    - port: 80         # Service's internal port
      targetPort: 8080 # Pod's container port
      nodePort: 30080  # External port on each node

3️⃣ Deploy & Test
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f nodeport.yaml


Check service:
kubectl get svc nginx-nodeport

You’ll see something like:

NAME              TYPE       CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
nginx-nodeport    NodePort   10.96.243.174   <none>        80:30080/TCP   10s


4️⃣ How to Access
From inside the cluster
You can use the service name:

curl http://nginx-nodeport.default.svc.cluster.local


From outside the cluster
Get the Node’s IP address:

kubectl get nodes -o wide


Example output:

NAME       STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION   INTERNAL-IP   EXTERNAL-IP
node1      Ready    <none>   10d   v1.27     192.168.1.10  34.122.45.20

If your node has an external IP (cloud or bare metal), you can directly run:
curl http://<External-IP>:30080


🔍 Important Details

Port range restriction:
NodePort must be between 30000–32767
If you don’t specify nodePort, Kubernetes assigns one automatically.

Available on all nodes:
Even if the pod is running on node2, <node1IP>:30080 will still work — kube-proxy forwards traffic.

Security:
NodePort exposes the service to the entire network where your nodes live.
In production, control access with firewalls or ingress rules.

Load Balancing:
Kubernetes does internal load balancing across all matching pods.
But clients must pick the node IP themselves (no DNS by default).


✅ Pros
Works anywhere — even without cloud LB
Simple setup
Good for testing/demo purposes

❌ Cons
Not user-friendly for public services (need IP + port)
Port range limitation
Less secure if exposed directly to the internet

Step-by-step Explanation of the Flow:

Client sends request to <NodeIP>:30080 :
NodeIP can be any worker node in the cluster.
NodePort is from range 30000–32767.


kube-proxy intercepts the request on that node:
Checks if a NodePort service matches that port.
Forwards the traffic to the service's ClusterIP.


Service sends request to one of the registered pod endpoints:
Endpoints are the Pod IP + TargetPort pairs.
Selection is round-robin.


Pod receives the request and responds:
Response goes back through kube-proxy → Node → Client.


2️⃣ Limitation of NodePort:

Exposes service at a high random port (30000–32767) on every node’s IP.
User must remember both:
Node’s IP address or DNS
Specific port number
This is not user-friendly, especially for public-facing applications.

Example problem:
Instead of just https://google.com, you’d have to enter something like
https://google.com:30459
That’s hard to remember and ugly for public URLs.

3️⃣ When NodePort is Acceptable:

Good for internal services (dashboards, monitoring UIs) where:
Only internal users or applications access it.
You don’t care about nice public URLs

4️⃣ When You Need LoadBalancer:

For public-facing services where:
Users access via a clean domain like https://google.com (no port in URL).
Service needs to be accessible over the internet without requiring port numbers.

LoadBalancer uses your cloud provider’s load balancer to:
Give you a single external IP/DNS.
Route traffic internally to NodePort and then to ClusterIP

5️⃣ How LoadBalancer Works

When you create a LoadBalancer service:

Cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) automatically provisions a load balancer.
That load balancer routes traffic to a NodePort service (which Kubernetes also creates automatically).
NodePort service then sends traffic to the ClusterIP service.
This chain is automatic — you don’t manually create NodePort or ClusterIP.

📌 In Short:
LoadBalancer = Public-friendly external IP/DNS without needing to remember ports.
Internally, it still uses NodePort + ClusterIP under the hood.


💡 First, remember:
ClusterIP = internal service (pods talk to each other)
NodePort = opens a port on each node for outside access
LoadBalancer = gives you a public IP/DNS (usually from a cloud provider)


🔹 What the statement means
When you create a LoadBalancer service in Kubernetes, you only write:
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer


You do not need to create:

A NodePort service
A ClusterIP service
Because Kubernetes automatically creates them internally as part of the LoadBalancer setup


📜 The Hidden Chain
When you define type: LoadBalancer:

Cloud Load Balancer (AWS ELB, Azure LB, GCP LB, etc.) gets created.
This is outside Kubernetes.
It has a public IP / DNS.

That cloud load balancer needs to send traffic into the cluster.
It does this by sending traffic to a NodePort.

The NodePort service is automatically created by Kubernetes (you don’t see it as a separate object in YAML — it’s part of the LoadBalancer).
The NodePort forwards the traffic to the ClusterIP.

The ClusterIP service then forwards the request to the pod endpoints.

🔹 Visualization

🌍 User → [Cloud Load Balancer Public IP]
           ↓
   NodePort (auto-created inside cluster)
           ↓
   ClusterIP (auto-created inside cluster)
           ↓
   Pod(s)


🔹 Why is it done this way?
Because:

LoadBalancer services still need a way to talk to pods inside the cluster.
The easiest way is to use the existing NodePort mechanism.
And NodePort already relies on ClusterIP to do internal load balancing.
So the internal chain is:
LoadBalancer → NodePort → ClusterIP → Pods


3️⃣ LoadBalancer
📜 Description

Works only with cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.).
Automatically provisions an external load balancer.
Distributes traffic across nodes/pods.

📦 Example YAML
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: public-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: web
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 8080


✅ Pros
Simple way to expose apps publicly
Built-in cloud load balancing

❌ Cons
Costs money (cloud LB pricing)
Works only in cloud-supported environments

🎯 When to Use
Production workloads that need public access

🧠 Additional Key Points for LoadBalancer Services (Interview Perspective)

1️⃣ How It Works Internally
Externally → You get a public IP / DNS from the cloud provider.
Internally → It’s still just a NodePort + ClusterIP chain under the hood.
Cloud LB → Sends traffic to NodePort → ClusterIP → Pods.


2️⃣ Cloud Provider Dependency

Works out-of-the-box with managed Kubernetes (EKS, AKS, GKE, DigitalOcean, etc.).
Bare-metal clusters don’t get an actual cloud LB — you must integrate with tools like:
MetalLB (open-source load balancer for bare-metal clusters)
Or manually provision an external LB and point it to the NodePort.

3️⃣ Multiple Ports
LoadBalancer services can expose multiple ports (HTTP, HTTPS, etc.).
ports:
  - name: http
    port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
  - name: https
    port: 443
    targetPort: 8443


4️⃣ Static IPs
By default, the LB IP is ephemeral — may change if recreated.
Many cloud providers let you reserve a static IP and assign it to your LoadBalancer service (important for DNS stability).


6️⃣ Traffic Policies

ExternalTrafficPolicy: Local
Preserves the client’s original IP to the pod.
Only routes traffic to nodes running the pod.

ExternalTrafficPolicy: Cluster (default)
Can route to any pod in the cluster (even on different nodes).
Original client IP is replaced with the LB’s IP


8️⃣ Common Interview Questions

“Explain the difference between NodePort and LoadBalancer.”
“What happens internally when you create a LoadBalancer service?”
“How would you expose a public service on bare metal?”
“How do you preserve the client’s original IP in a LoadBalancer setup?”
“How can you avoid multiple LoadBalancers if you have many services?”
(Answer: Use an Ingress controller + one LoadBalancer

1️⃣ What is a NetworkPolicy?
In Kubernetes, by default all pods can talk to all other pods in the same cluster.

This means:

Any pod can send traffic to any other pod (no restrictions).
This is fine for development, but not secure for production.


Problem:
If a hacker compromises one pod, they can try to talk to your database, cache, API, or any other pod — because the default is “everything is open.”

Solution:
A NetworkPolicy is a Kubernetes object that controls which pods are allowed to communicate with each other (or with the outside world).


2️⃣ How does it work?
A NetworkPolicy is like a firewall rule at the pod level.

You define:

Which pods it applies to (podSelector).
What traffic directions to control (Ingress, Egress).
Which sources/destinations are allowed (other pods, namespaces, IP ranges).
Which ports are allowed.
Important: NetworkPolicies only work if your cluster network plugin supports them (e.g., Calico, Cilium, Weave Net).


3️⃣ Ingress vs Egress (in NetworkPolicy)
These do not mean “Ingress Controller” or “Egress Gateway” here.
They are just traffic directions for network rules:

Ingress → incoming traffic to the pod.
Example: requests coming from other pods or the internet into your pod.
Egress → outgoing traffic from the pod.
Example: requests your pod makes to other pods, databases, or external APIs.

📌 Without any NetworkPolicy
All Ingress is allowed (any pod can send requests to yours).
All Egress is allowed (your pod can send requests anywhere).

📌 With NetworkPolicy:
You can restrict Ingress or Egress (or both).



4️⃣ Simple Examples

Example A: Deny all Ingress traffic (but allow outgoing)

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: deny-all-ingress
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  podSelector: {}   # Apply to ALL pods in this namespace
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress         # Only controlling incoming traffic
  ingress: []       # Empty = block all incoming


📌 Effect:

No pod in my-namespace can receive traffic from any other pod (or outside).


Example B: Allow Ingress only from specific pods

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-frontend-to-db
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: database         # This policy applies to pods with this label
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: frontend     # Only pods with this label can send requests
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3306            # Only allow MySQL port


📌 Effect:

Only pods labeled app=frontend can talk to pods labeled app=database on port 3306.
All other pods are blocked.


Example C: Deny all Egress traffic (no outgoing allowed)

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: deny-all-egress
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Egress
  egress: []    # Empty = block all outgoing

📌 Effect:
Pods cannot talk to any other pods or external IPs.


Example D: Allow Egress only to an external IP range


apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-to-google
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: backend
  policyTypes:
  - Egress
  egress:
  - to:
    - ipBlock:
        cidr: 8.8.8.8/32   # Google DNS
    ports:
    - protocol: UDP
      port: 53             # DNS queries


📌 Effect:

Only DNS requests to 8.8.8.8 are allowed.
All other outgoing traffic is blocked.


5️⃣ Summary Table for You

| Term            | Meaning in NetworkPolicy context |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Ingress**     | Incoming traffic to pods         |
| **Egress**      | Outgoing traffic from pods       |
| **podSelector** | Which pods this rule applies to  |
| **from**        | Who can send traffic to my pod   |
| **to**          | Where my pod can send traffic    |
| **ports**       | Which port(s) are allowed        |



6️⃣ Key CKAD / Interview Points

Default behavior: Without NetworkPolicy → all traffic allowed.
NetworkPolicies are namespaced (apply only in their namespace).
They add restrictions, they don’t “open” new traffic paths unless there’s already a restriction.
Order doesn’t matter — Kubernetes evaluates all matching policies together.
Need a CNI plugin that supports them.



The "Ingress" you see in that Service Exposure Comparison table is not the same as the "ingress" keyword in NetworkPolicy.

They are two completely different concepts in Kubernetes that just happen to share the same word.
Let’s untangle them.


3️⃣ Quick analogy
Imagine your house:

Ingress (resource) = The gatekeeper at your main entrance who decides:
“People coming for the living room → go left, people coming for the kitchen → go right.”

ingress (NetworkPolicy) = The security system at your door that decides:
“Only friends and family can enter — strangers blocked.”


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1️⃣ What is Kubernetes Ingress?
Ingress is a Kubernetes resource that routes HTTP/HTTPS requests from outside the cluster to services inside the cluster.

Instead of creating multiple LoadBalancer services (costly) or using multiple NodePorts (ugly URLs with ports), Ingress lets you:
Use one external IP/DNS.

Route to different services based on:
Path (/, /api, /shop)
Host (app1.example.com, app2.example.com).


2️⃣ Why Ingress?
Without Ingress:

Each public service needs its own LoadBalancer (cloud cost) or NodePort (hard to remember).
You have no central place to manage routing rules, TLS/SSL, etc.

With Ingress:

You can have one LoadBalancer or NodePort entry point.
You define routing rules in a single YAML.
You can manage TLS certificates for HTTPS in one place.


3️⃣ How Ingress Works

User sends HTTP request → myapp.com/api
DNS resolves myapp.com → Ingress Controller's external IP (via LoadBalancer/NodePort)
Ingress Controller checks the Ingress resource rules.
Request is forwarded to the matching service (ClusterIP) inside the cluster.
Service routes to a pod.


🔹 Required Components
Ingress Resource – The YAML with routing rules.

Ingress Controller – The actual reverse proxy (e.g., NGINX, Traefik, HAProxy) that:
Watches Ingress resources.
Configures itself automatically.
Handles TLS termination, path rewriting, etc.


4️⃣ Example Ingress YAML
Imagine you have two services:

frontend-service (serves /)
api-service (serves /api)


apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: myapp-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:
  rules:
  - host: myapp.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: frontend-service
            port:
              number: 80
      - path: /api
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: api-service
            port:
              number: 80


📌 How it works:

http://myapp.com/ → frontend-service
http://myapp.com/api → api-service


5️⃣ TLS/HTTPS with Ingress
Ingress can handle HTTPS termination by attaching a TLS secret:


5️⃣ TLS/HTTPS with Ingress
Ingress can handle HTTPS termination by attaching a TLS secret:

spec:
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - myapp.com
    secretName: my-tls-secret


This way:

TLS handshake happens at the Ingress Controller.
Traffic inside the cluster can remain HTTP.



6️⃣ Common Features of Ingress

Host-based routing: Different domains to different services.
Path-based routing: Different URLs to different services.
TLS termination: Manage SSL certs in one place.
Rewrite rules: Modify URLs before sending to the backend.
Rate limiting / auth: Some controllers support security features.
